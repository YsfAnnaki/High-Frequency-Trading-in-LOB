Project done from February 2022 to April 2022.
## Summary

The goal of this work is to study a high frequency market-making strategy inspired from the work of Marco Avellaneda & Sasha Stoikov in High-frequency trading in a limit order
book (2006). Given the current state of the limit order book, we introduce the notion of the "indifference price" and we determine the optimal spread and bid/ask orders to quote on the order book based on a stochastic control approach. In order to analyze the performance of the market_making strategy, we use 1 day worth of granular order book data and tick data for different stocks (AXA, BNP, CARREFOUR, LVMH, TOTAL) and we build and implement a market-making strategy based on the findings of Marco Avellaneda & Sasha Stoikov.
This work focuses on the following subjects:
- General formulation of the Stochastic Control framework and the definition of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation related to this stochastic control problem (for finite & infinite trading time horizon).
-
